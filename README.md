# NVIM setup
In this repo you'll find all the `.lua` files I use for my nvim setup. It includes:
* auto-complete and language servers for:
  * C/C++
  * JavaScript/TypeScript
  * HTML
  * CSS
  * Python
  * PHP
  * SQL/MySQL
  * GLSL
* telescope for:
  * find files in project
  * live grep in project
  * find in buffer
* treesitter for nice syntax highlighting etc.
* nvimtree for an epic file explorer
* some custom keybindings, notably:
  * <Alt>+n to switch to tab `n`
* a cool theme though I honest don't remember the name
* some settings for how tabs should work, `set number`, etc.
* a todo plugin for managing `TODO`, `FIXME`, `WARNING`, etc.

**Make sure you have NVIM version `0.10+` for all the plugins to work.** // TODO: mention vim.uv caveat

# Font
Should be noted that it's good to have a font installed that has icons. I'm using [FireCode](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads) from `nerdfonts.com`.

To install: // TODO: explain installation process
